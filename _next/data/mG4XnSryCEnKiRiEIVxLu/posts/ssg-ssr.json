Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>\n<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p>\n","title":"When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering","date":"2020-01-02"}},"__N_SSG":true}
