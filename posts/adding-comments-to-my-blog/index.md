title: 'Adding Comments to a Markdown Blog (via Utterances)'

Creating my own blog is an important goal for me, which is why I wanted to add a comment section for each post.

Doing a little research, I found that many plugins that allow comments required creating a new account on their service, and that did not convince me.

I finally discovered [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/), an [open source project](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) that uses a GitHub account, and since almost all developers have an account created there, I decided to implement my comments section with this plugin.

I made a [repo dedicated to comments](https://github.com/randymorales/randymorales.dev-comments) to host them as issues and their responses. You must connect to the Utterances GitHub app to leave a comment on a post, although you can also comment directly through GitHub if the issue exists.

All the instructions on how to setup Utterances can be found on its [website](https://utteranc.es/).

Now everyone will be able to participate in discussions and leave helpful comments ðŸ¤©.
