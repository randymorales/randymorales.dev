# ☢️ [randymorales.dev](https://randymorales.dev) ☣️

Randy's personal website. The idea behind this website is to share knowledge and build a community or network around interesting topics in Computer Programming.

Feel free to contribute, I am open to suggestions.

## 🏗 Project Structure

- `components/*`: Custom react components.
- `lib/*`: Helper functions and constants.
- `pages/*`: Static and dynamic pages.
- `posts/*`: Blog posts content.
- `public/*`: Static files.
- `styles/*`: CSS.

- `.github/workflows/*`: Scripts to deploy in GitHub Pages. This was stopped since NextJS does not support `i18n` with `next export`. Deploying to vercel by the moment.

## 🔧 Dev Steps

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
